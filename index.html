        United Hearts is a non-profit organisation that aims to raise awareness
        of the number of orphans in Jakarta who are not getting the education
        they need, and to help them receive the education they deserve. Through
        exciting lessons, we hope we will be able to increase their knowledge
        and help improve the quality of education in underprivileged parts of
        Jakarta.

        United Hearts has been planning for this collaboration with Yayasan Prima Unggul.
        YPU is a place where children get to show their talents and build their characters.
        The children are not as privileged as us. However, they are still very hardworking
        and thankful for the chances they get to further develop their skills and talents.
        United Hearts decided to help teach the children in YPU how to communicate in 
        English. We are so happy to be able to share our knowledge to people around us in
        this season of giving.
